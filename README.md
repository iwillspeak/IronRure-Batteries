Nuget Package of Rust Regex C API.

This repository contains pre-built versions of the rust regex library for Windows, Linux and macOS. You shouldn't need to add a reference to these libraries yourself, they're referenced from [`IronRure`](https://github.com/iwillspeak/IronRure). It might come in useful if you need to target a new platform though.

## Windows Gotchas

The windows build requires the `vc140` redistributable to work. This means you need to have Visual Studio 2015 or the [Visual Studio 2015 C++ Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145) installed for it to load. If not you'll get an exception which claims that `rure.dll` can't be found.
